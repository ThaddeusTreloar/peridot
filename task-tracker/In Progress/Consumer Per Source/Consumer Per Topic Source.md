When benching, it seems that we are hitting the limits of a what a single consumer can handle. It can be seen that pipelines are constantly starved, recieving empty queue notifications, and having to wait til the queue becomes non empty.

This problem may be solved by moving to a queue per topic source model, where each topic source has it's own consumer.  It will also be a great opportunity to combine the changelog and consumer managers as having them separated isn't working out very well.
